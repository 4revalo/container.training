    # From Docker to Kubernetes

    - We are now going to run a demo app made of multiple containers

    - We will start by running it on one node, with Compose

    - Then we will deploy that application on a Kubernetes cluster

    - We will identify performance bottlenecks and scale out that app

      (and learn Kubernetes in the process)

    ---

    ## Our new environment

    - Since a 1-node cluster isn't fun, we will switch to a new environment!

    - This environment is a 4-node Kubernetes cluster

    - Also, from now on, demos and labs are identified with these gray boxes

    .exercise[
    - You should run this command:
      ```bash
      echo Hello world
      ```
