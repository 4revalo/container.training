# Our sample application

No assignment

# Kubernetes concepts

Do we want some kind of multiple-choice quiz?

# First contact with kubectl

Start some pre-defined image and check its logs
(Do we want to make a custom "mystery image" that shows a message
and then sleeps forever?)

Start another one (to make sure they understand that they need
to specify a unique name each time)

Provide as many ways as you can to figure out on which node
these pods are running (even if you only have one node).

# Exposing containers

Start a container running the official tomcat image.
Expose it.
Connect to it.

# Shipping apps

(We need a few images for a demo app other than DockerCoins?)

Start the components of the app.
Expose what needs to be exposed.
Connect to the app and check that it works.
